FAQ:

------------------------------
**Usage is very very simple:**

    // some code...
    
    @Warning("This method should be refactored")
    public void someCodeWhichYouNeedAtTheMomentButYouWantToRefactorItLater() {
        // bad stuff going on here...
    }


Notice, if you use another annotation processors â€” you may need to exclude 
    
    'META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor'
    
For Android Gradle setup in can be done like that:

    build.gradle:
    
    android {
        
        // ...
        
        packagingOptions {
            exclude 'META-INF/services/javax.annotation.processing.Processor'
        }
    }
